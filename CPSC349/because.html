      <ul>
        <li>Many employers seem to be looking for people who are skilled in open source systems</li>
        <li>HTML seems to be a ubiquitous necessary skill with any positions. Even if the position does not involve any web development</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I would not say that I have any previous experience with web development, however, I have dabbled in HTML and CSS for a number of school projects over the years.
        For example, I have had to make an online portfolio that is a sort of "showcase" for my video game projects. This portfolio was done by taking an HTML and CSS
        skeleton I have edited it to include links to my work. I also had another school project where we recreated a version of an online resturaunt market where
        users could login as a customer or a resturaunt owner and order different items depending on their access level.
