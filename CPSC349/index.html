          This is the intriduction to the first HTML in class excersise that
          is due on July 9th, 2020. The assignment is to intoduce myself and
          share a little bit about my inteersts.

          When I am not being quarentined, I can usually be found training
          Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which is a martial art that originated in feudal
          Japan but then migrated to Brazil in the late 1800's. It was further
          developed and gained popularity. It can be compared to American
          wrestling in many ways in the sense that it is a grappling martial
          art and does not have any strikes (punching, kicking, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          If im not training brazilian jiu Jitsu you can probably find me at
          the beach if the weather is good and inside playing video games or
          watching anime when the weather isnt so good.
